### Services
AWS Kinesis monitoring encompasses several specialized services, each targeting specific aspects of data streaming performance:

1. Kinesis Data Streams
    * Description: Manages the ingestion and processing of real-time data streams.
    
2. Shard Management
    * Description: Manages the shards within a Kinesis stream, including their creation, deletion, and scaling.
    
3. Data Ingestion
    * Description: Handles the ingestion of data into Kinesis streams.
    
4. Data Processing
    * Description: Processes the ingested data and prepares it for downstream applications.
    
5. Latency Management
    * Description: Monitors and manages the end-to-end latency of data processing within Kinesis.
    
### KPIs
Each service utilizes specific KPIs to measure its effectiveness:

1. Kinesis Data Streams
    * Description: Manages the ingestion and processing of real-time data streams.
    
2. Shard Count
    * Description: Number of active shards in the stream.
    
3. Shard Read Throughput
    * Description: Read throughput per shard.
    
4. Shard Write Throughput
    * Description: Write throughput per shard.
    
5. Incoming Records
    * Description: Number of records being ingested into the Kinesis stream.
    
6. Incoming Bytes
    * Description: Number of bytes being ingested per second.
    
7. Throttled Records
    * Description: Number of records throttled during ingestion.
    
8. Processed Records
    * Description: Number of records processed.
    
9. Processing Latency
    * Description: Time taken to process data.
    
10. Processing Errors
    * Description: Number of errors encountered during processing.
    
11. End-to-End Latency
    * Description: Total time from data ingestion to processing completion.
    
12. Iterator Age
    * Description: Age of the oldest record in the stream.
    
13. Ingestion Errors
    * Description: Number of errors during data ingestion.
    
14. Processing Errors
    * Description: Number of errors during data processing.
    
15. Throttled Requests
    * Description: Number of requests throttled due to errors.
    

### Relationships
#### Dependencies: 
Services are interconnected; for instance, Kinesis Data Streams is dependent on Shard Management, Data Ingestion, and Data Processing. Similarly, Data Processing relies on Latency Management and Error Handling to ensure timely and error-free data processing.

#### Hierarchical Structure: 
Some services form a hierarchy, such as Data Processing depending on Latency Management and Error Handling, illustrating a layered approach to performance monitoring where base metrics support broader performance indicators.
